      <h4>History:</h4>
      <h3>
        Hi there! I have a love for invention and 
        technology which started back in High school. I took 4 years 
        of a Computer Technology course where I excelled. My Senior year I 
        took a HTML class which made me fall in love with programming.
        As you can see in my resume, I went on to pursue another passion 
        of mine, Health and nutrition. Sadly, the Universities changed the 
        standard for Physical Therapy to were you need a Doctorate, 
        after my Bachelors (with an average of a 3.0 GPA ) I decided to 
        chase my dream of programming. Right now, I am still at school 
        to get a programming degree and I am set to graduate by the end of 
        2021.

      <h4>A little bit about me:</h4>
      <h3>
        My hobbies are a little different than your average persons. I do 
        a lot of 3d design and 3dprinting. I had 3 3d printers at one time 
        because I couldn't wait to get 3d prints out. I mainly focus on 
        ergonomic and quality of life designs. I also love to go kayaking
        and every year I will try my best to get out of the state on a big
        adventure. I have been to multiple European countries, China, 
        Puerto Rico, Mexico, Alaska, and every state in the USA.

      <h4>My animals:</h4>
      <h3>
        I have 2 wonderful Rabbits! Toast and Waffles, they weigh in at 18 pounds each
        and free roam my house. My girlfriend and I recently found a beautiful
        black lab puppy at the Humane society and couldn't resist adopting her and naming her
        Meringue. If my house wasnt already strange enough I also have a Leopard Gecho named
        Peachy. Yes, all my animals are named after food. No idea why...

      <h4>Hopes and dreams:</h4>
      <h3>
        As far as my future, I am hoping to find a company that can overlook
        my inexperience and see that I have an amazing amount
        of drive. Programming is a love of mine and I am more than willing to put in
        the work and time it takes to become an expert at it.
